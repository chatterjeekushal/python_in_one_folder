#conditional statements in python



The if statement
The if-else statement
The nested-if statement
The if-elif-else ladder




#Python if statement

The if statement is the most simple decision-making statement. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not.



Syntax:

if condition:
   # Statements to execute if
   # condition is true




#Python If-Else Statement


The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false it won’t. But if we want to do something else if the condition is false, we can use the else statement with the if statement to execute a block of code when the if condition is false. 

Syntax of Python If-Else:



   if (condition):
    # Executes this block if
    # condition is true
else:
    # Executes this block if
    # condition is false





   # Nested-If Statement in Python


A nested if is an if statement that is the target of another if statement. Nested if statements mean an if statement inside another if statement.

Yes, Python allows us to nest if statements within if statements. i.e., we can place an if statement inside another if statement.

Syntax:

if (condition1):
   # Executes when condition1 is true
   if (condition2): 
      # Executes when condition2 is true
   # if Block is end here
# if Block is end here




# Python if-elif-else Ladder


Here, a user can decide among multiple options. The if statements are executed from the top down.

As soon as one of the conditions controlling the if is true, the statement associated with that if is executed, and the rest of the ladder is bypassed. If none of the conditions is true, then the final “else” statement will be executed




Syntax: 

if (condition):
    statement
elif (condition):
    statement
.

else:
    statement
