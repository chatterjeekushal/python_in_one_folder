# short hand if else 

#If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line:

a=30
b=20

print("a") if a<b else print("b")


c = 330
d = 330

print("A") if c > d else print("=") if c == d else print("B")


a = 33
b = 200
if not a > b:
    print("a is NOT greater than b")
